I have been programming for a while. Encouraged by <Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman>, I decided to record my Long Road and Reflecting my daily improvement.

As a self-taught software engineer, I learn a lot from this awesome book.

This is a new start for me. And this time I will do it right.
